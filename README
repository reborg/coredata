= CoreData -- Object persistence on top of the native Core Data persistency framework

CoreData is an object persistence library inspired by ActiveRecord and DataMapper.
CoreData sits on top of the native Core Data and allows MacRuby applications to
persist their objects seamlessly.

== Whirl-wind tour

Install: macgem install coredata
Use:

  require 'coredata'
  class PersistentObject
    include CoreData
    property :id, Serial
    property :title, String
  end

  @my_obj = PersistentObject.create(:title => "Hello World!")
